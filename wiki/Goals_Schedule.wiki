#summary Project goal and schedule

= Introduction =

Goal of this project is to create open source libraries and code example on Mac OS X in the factory automation / industrial automation domain. As an example, free open protocol Modbus was selected. 

First phase of this project would be a rapid development to make a working prototype to test the concept and gather useful experience. Second part of the project would be cleaning up the code, adding feature and robustness. 

A mixture of C++ and Objective-C/Cocoa was selected for implementation, since Core C++ code could be reused on other Operating Systems. A thin layer over C++ Core will be developed in Cocoa for interfacing. Serial port or TCP/IP port pooling and inter-process/inter-thread communication will be done in Cocoa to utilize existing Mac OS X technologies, instead of making C++ libraries using POSIX calls. 

A simple GUI will be developed to test the working prototype and may be extended to a more feature-rich in the second phase. 

_As a long-term goal, this project will become of a SCADA solution for Mac OS X, hopefully getting enough visibility to introduce Macs into this domain_

= Details =

As of 06/06/2007:

Working prototype:

1. Core - 80% done. 
     - Needed: 
         * Message classes for each function code for convenience.
         * Final testing and verification. 

2. Comm - to be started from about 06/08~
